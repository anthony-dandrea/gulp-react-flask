# Flask and React Small POC

- You need Ruby. If you're running OSX it'll be on your system already.
- Install sass, compass, and breakpoint for styles `gem install sass compass breakpoint`.
- You need Python for the backend. It'll be on OSX already. I'm using `2.7.9`.
- You will need to install Pip for Python. Once you have pip run `pip install - requirements.txt`. 
- You need Node. `brew install node`. For versioning you can use the tool n - `npm install -g n`. I am currently using `v0.12.7`.
- Install gulp globally `npm install -g gulp`.
- Install node modules `npm install`.
- Run `gulp` to compile and develop.

If you're having problems with the i18n task you can install i18next-conv globally, `npm install i18next-conv -g`.

Run `gulp build` to make i18n compatible scripts and minify js.
